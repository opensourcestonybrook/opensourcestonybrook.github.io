        <h2>More About Open Source</h2>
        <p>
        Open source software is software that is shared freely and available to build upon. It is a great way to apply your skills to real-world projects and social causes. You can participate by writing or reviewing code, answering users' questions, translating the interface to another language, making video tutorials to help new users, and myriad other ways. Open source software is often produced by lots of people collaborating across time and space, and this event specially welcomes newcomers to that style of development.</p>
